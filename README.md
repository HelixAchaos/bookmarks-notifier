# bookmarks-notifier
I have lots of bookmarks. I need an easier way to see how behind I am on fanfictions, mangas, animes, light novels, etc. I am thinking of making one for AniList next.

TODO:
1. add update date and last-grabbed date (so we can see if there was an update since the last time the script was ran)
2. add requirements.txt
3. detect updates on ao3 series (not just one link)
4. include authors
5. handle other sites. look out for mangadex, light novel sites, other manga sites, and wattpad.
6. mangasushi may have changed the urls for a few (en-name to jp-name). make a way to search for the jp-name-version through mangasushi's search.
7. land on a manga's page (not a chapter), and know if it updated or not.



1,3-4, 7 will require a proper db
3-4 will use 1


CURRENT:
1. ffn
2. ao3
3. mangasushi
4. mangakakalot
